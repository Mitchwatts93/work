# TODO:
# build vectorisers - based on XXcustomers.txt and products.txt 
# be able to retrieve vectors for each, based on a df supplied
# get the list of previous products

# find the similarity to each product for the user

# maybe find users that have bought the product, and get the similarity to all of those users?

# after that, build a model based on both the user vector and the item vector
# maybe also encode the views? 

# after all of that build a hybrid system - 
# do this by encoding user and item vectors in both ways, and passing through nn
# or by predicting prob from each, and using blender model?
