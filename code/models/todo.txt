the collaborative filtering seems to work now, even though slow. but whats up with the similarity?
did you delete the existing remote code when you did scp? I think you did?....
whats next?
collaborative filtering has lots of zeros in the similarities
i.e. the similarity of this product to previous purchases is often zeros
is it literally just the cosine sim?
maybe try a matrix facotrisation approach? so that theres some overlaps?
